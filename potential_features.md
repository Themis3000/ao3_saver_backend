### Potential features

These are ideas for features that I'd like to consider adding one day down the road. I'm keeping a list, so I don't forget about them.

- Automatic backup of existing bookmarked fics
  - Perhaps make this a feature detached from the extension? Could have a website like archive.org's wayback machine, but specifically for fics.
- Local storage/self-hosting
