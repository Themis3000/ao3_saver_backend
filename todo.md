## Todo list

- [ ] Change default archive type from pdf to html, or epub.
  - Note: html doesn't bundle images. html has the smallest file size, but epub is close.
  - If I go with epub, be sure to get some sort of web epub reader going.
- [ ] Find when work with newer updated time didn't actually update, do not re-archive
- update to psycopg3
